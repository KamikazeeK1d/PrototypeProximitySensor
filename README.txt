Plug the jumper cables and the ultrasonic sensor into the breadboard and connect it with the particle argon.

Ultrasonic Sensor: VCC pin=VUSB pin, Trig pin=D4, Echo pin=D5, GND pin=GND pin on argon

Buzzer: positive pin=D7 pin on argon, negative pin=GND pin on argon

Plug the particle argon into the computer.

Open up the particle IDE.

Flash the code onto the argon 

hc-sr04andbuzzer.ino

The project should be working.
